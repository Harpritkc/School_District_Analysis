# School_District_Analysis
This is all project for school  for standardized testing data for analysis and reporting and presentation to provide insight about performance trends and patterns   
## Challenge
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested for updated data summaries. After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

When assessing average scores and passing percentages among the 15 high schools in the school district, the average math score dropped .1, the average reading score stayed the same, the percentage passing math dropped 1%, the percentage passing reading dropped 1%, and the overall passing percent dropped 1%.

When assessing school summaries and performing schools, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools. Thomas High School ranked second place in the top five performing schools with a 91% overall passing. After replacing both math and reading scores, Thomas High School was taken out of the top five category since they now display a 65% overall passing. On the plus side, these changes did not place Thomas High School among the bottom five performing schools. Those ranks remained the same. Per the revised School Summary, Thomas High School now ranks 8th place among 15 high schools in the district.
